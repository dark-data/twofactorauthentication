# twofactorauthentication
In this project, we introduce a new fine-grained two-factor authentication (2FA) access control system on web-based cloud computing services. In our proposed 2FA access control system, an attribute-based access control mechanism is implemented with the necessity of both user secret key and a lightweight security services. As a user cannot access the system or download files requested. if s/he does not hold both authentication, the mechanism can enhance the security of the system, especially in those scenarios where many users share the same computer for web-based cloud services. the application can deploy the web application directly AWS cloud (EBS - elastic beanstalk) for deployment, computation and storage purpose for database we use MS Access which comes with build 'war' file itself.
